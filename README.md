# Day07_About-me
13.05.2025 || A simple created website only used HTML where I talk a little bit about myself

Another ChatGPT challenge day. This time I had to create a website about me and myself.
Although the instructions did not tell me to give the img a width or height but if I had not
done that, my whole picture would have covered the whole page BAHAHAH. 

The insctrucions:
<ul>
        <li>A main heading - e.g. "Hello, I"m ..." or "About Me"</li>
        <li>At least one image:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the &lt;img&gt; element</li>
            <li>You can use a photo of yourself or something that represents you</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A short paragraph using &lt;p&gt; - Talk a little about yourself, your hobbies or why you're learning to code</li>
        <li>A list of 3-5 things you can enjoy or care about. You can use &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;</li>
        <li>Use &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; to emphasize something you want the visitor to remember</li>
    </ul>
